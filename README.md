# Hi, I’m Renee. Welcome to my GitHub! 

💪🏻 My job here is to code new things to all my heart's desires, and your job 🫵🏻 is to have fun while you're her! 

About Me: I'm a detail-oriented and quality-focused Data Science and Mathematics sophomore with a passion for exploring its intersection. 
I'm excited to tackle challenges that push the boundaries of current technological capabilities, with a particular interest in applying these skills in all realms 
including finance, biotech, and data analysis. 

Beyond tech, I have an underlying passion for education. I find fulfillment in being able to share the knowledge that I've learned with others. 

Pronouns: she/her
